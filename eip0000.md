## Abstract
This specification defines an extension to the [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) standard. The extension adds a standardized API for storing ownership information in merkle trees.

## Motivation
A standard interface for merkle-provable ownership allows users to prove ownership of an asset without revealing private account-related information, by using zk-SNARKs.

Using merkle trees for storing a hash of ```address``` and ```tokenId``` of token holders in the leafs, zk-SNARKs can be employed for generating private, off-chain merkle-proofs, used for on-chain verification. By proving to have access to a certain private key that maps to a stored address and by providing the correct merkle-proof, a user can prove to own a certain asset without revealing the asset or any account information. 

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every `ERC0000` compliant contract MUST implement the `ERC-721` (`0x80ac58cd`) and `ERC165` (`0x01ffc9a7`) interfaces:

## Rationale
`EIP-0000` emerged from the need to proof ownership of non-fungible tokens without revealing private information. While users might want to prove the ownership of a NFT-concert ticket, they might not want to reveal personal account-related information at the same time. Privacy-preserving solutions require standards to gain adoption, therefore it is critical to focus on generalisable ways of implement ownership-proofs into related contracts.

This extension enables to directly implement the tools (```Merkle Tree``` contract and ```Verifier``` contract) required for zero-knowledge ownership proofs into their token contracts. In addition to ```name``` and ```symbol```, issuers MUST specify the number of levels in the ```Merkle Tree``` and the address of the ```Verifier``` contract during deployment. 

`EIP-0000` extends [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) contracts in a way to provide users possibilities to prove ownership in privacy-preserving ways. Basically, the contract maintains information about ownership in a merkle tree, in addition to commonly used mappings. Using zk-SNARKs (e.g. `PrivKeyToAddr`, `PubkeyToAddress`, `ECDSAVerify` circuits; see github at [0xPARC/circom-ecdsa](https://github.com/0xPARC/circom-ecdsa)), users can generate off-chain merkle-proofs and submit them to the contract for verification.
Implementing EIP-0000 adds a merkle tree with ownership information to the [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) standard. The merkle-tree MUST represent a separate contract that allows only the token contract to add new leafs. 

The ```Merkle Tree``` contract MUST use the same hash function than the proving circuits. 

The ```Merkle Tree``` contract SHALL have an arbitrary number of levels, which depends on the required number of leafs. 

The ```Verifier``` contract MUST represent a separate, immutable contract.

The ```Verifier``` contract MUST have functionalities in place to decode abi-encoded data.
 
## Backwards Compatibility
EIP--- is not backwards compatibly with basic `ERC-721` contracts. `EIP---` implements the [`EIP-165`](./eip-165.md) standard.

## Reference Implementation
You can find an implementation of this standard in  [assets/eip0000.sol](./assets).

## Security Considerations
Merkle-trees are defined and created during deployment and cannot be enlarged.
